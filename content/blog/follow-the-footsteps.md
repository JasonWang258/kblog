title: Follow  the footsteps
description: My first story
---
There once was an lonely child🧒. He had no friends and nothing to play with.

One day he found footsteps👣. "I think it's someone's footsteps". Said the lonely child.

So the child followed the footsteps. First he passed a house🏠. Next he passed the skateboard park🛹. 

Then he followed the footsteps behind a tree🌲 and there was a person🕺 making a clone machine and a cookie machine. 

"Can I have the clone machine please"? Said the child. 

"No, I want a clone".  "I can give you the cookie🍪 machine". Said the person🧔.

 "I don't want the cookie machine, I want the clone🕺machine". Said the child. 

So the person🧔said "It is my first creation"! 

"I can return the clone🕺 machine, can't I"? Said the child. 

"No,you can't". Said the person🧔. 

“Why not”. Said the child. "No because you can only clone one person". Said the person🧔.

So the child and the person said the same thing at the same time. They said "lets make it half me and you"!      

So they did. So the lonely child was never lonely again, he was a happy child. THE END
