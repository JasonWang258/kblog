description: My first story

There once was an lonely child🧒. He had no friends and nothing to play with.

One day he found footsteps👣. "I think it's someone's footsteps". Said the lonely child.

So the child followed the footsteps. First he passed a house. Next he passed the skateboard park. 

Then he followed the footsteps behind a tree and there was a person making a friend machine and a cookie machine. "Can I have the friend machine please"? Said the child. "No, I want a friend". Said the adult. "I can give you the cookie machine".
