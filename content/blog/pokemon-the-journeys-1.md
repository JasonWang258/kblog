Yamper found a leaf stone and gave it to Goh. Goh used the leaf stone on Exeggcute and it evolved into a Exeggutor! Ash said it reminded him of an Alolan Exeggutor. "Lets go to Alola!" Ash said. "Yeah!" said Goh.

After they arrived they met Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet. Then Ash saw his old pokemon friends; Rowlet, Incineroar, Lycanroc and Melmetal. Goh caught a Pyukumuku. They were chasing after a grubbin when they got split up. Goh fell in the lake. Lana fished up Goh and went to the pokemon school together.

Goh got caught up in a ocean of questions. He wished ash would hurry up. Then Kiawe came. They battled each other in the battle field. Kiawe used a Z-Move right away. Marowak saved rabbifoot and Goh. They went back home full of energy for another adventure.
