Pichu gazed at the sunrise and began his adventure. He watched the other pokemon play with their siblings. Pichu wished he had someone to play with too. Then one day Pichu was playing near a cliff. Some Koffing came and surprised Pichu by sending a cloud of gas at him, he wasn't stable and fell of the cliff. The cliff was steep. Suddenly, a Kangaskhan caught Pichu. From this day on he had some one to play with. 

Goh was getting a tour of kanto from professor oak when he and chloe found Mew battling Nidoking. Nidoking looked really angry. Goh and Chloe gazed in awe when Nidoking used an attack and Mew sent it right back at Nidoking. Nidoking fainted and Mew laughed happily. Goh chased after Mew and found a li'l kanga playing with Mew. Li'l kanga fell of a cliff by accident. Kangaskhan and Pichu panicked. No worries 'cus Mews around. Mew used physic and rescued li'l kanga.

Everyday li'l kanga and Pichu grew bigger. Pichu was worried about Kangaskhan because he was to heavy for Kangaskhan to carry. His final decision was to leave Kangaskhan because he new it would be better without him. Pichu wiped of his tears and left Kangaskhan. At that moment, Pichu evolved to Pikachu. Pikachu looked at his new body and left. After some time, Pikachu ended up with ash. This is how the journey began.
