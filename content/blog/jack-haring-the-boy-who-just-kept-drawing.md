description: A book about pease and ART!
---
There was a boy named Jack.

When he was little, his father taught him how to draw dogs and fish and funny things.

His dad would draw a line, then Jack would draw one. Soon, the whole page would be full.

From that time on, Jack NEVER stopped drawing. In elementary shool, while taking tests, Jack doodled on the edge of the paper.
