There was a boy named Jack.

When he was little, his father taught him how to draw dogs and fish and funny things.

His dad would draw a line, then Jack would draw one. Soon, the whole page would be full.

From that time on, Jack **NEVER** stopped drawing. In elementary shool, while taking tests, Jack doodled on the edge of the paper. When he handed it in, the teacher asked, "why did you doodle on this important piece of paper ? " 

Jack didn't answer, he just went back to his desk and just kept drawing. As a teanager jack liked to draw with loud music playing on. His mother had to **yell** over the music and say, "why don't you turn off the music and ride your bike ?" But Jack had sold his bike for art supplies, so he answered, "why don't you look at my cool drawings ?"

In high school Jack moved to France to draw with other teanagers, while listening to music Jack started to draw slanted lines, when he handed it in, the teacher asked, " why did you draw slanted lines and not what I told you ?"

As he ran to get another sheet of paper, he said "I just want to draw somthing new". When he got a paper he drew circles.

everybody asked "why do you draw on everything"?

Jack said "everybody needs art".he disapeared. {maybe he got another piece of paper.}
